# GroceryStore -- Home is where the cart is!!!!
This is our second group project for Bootcamp.

This application will require you to sign up or login in.  After signing up or logging in, you will be directed to the Grocery Categories page.  

You will be able to select from one of the different product categories.   On the product category screen you will be able to logout by clicking on the logout button.   After clicking on one of the product categories, you will be directed to a new page containing all of the items in that category.  If you click on the item, nutritional information will be displayed and you will have the option to add to cart (this functionality is not working yet) or cancel.  You will be able to click the Go Back To Previous, which will return you to the Product Category page or Logout which will log you out of the system.  

We hope you enjoy our app.
